# Predicting Wine Quality

In this work I am using data mining techniques on collected wine sets and evaluating wine quality by given raw data.

## Inputs

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

## Output

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
